# üçã Dalt
This is a little webserver for monitoring and controlling devices in my workshop/grow room.

Dalt is a Raspberry Pi 3 B+ located in a small room off my garage named after [House Dalt](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/House_Dalt).  

## Current Connections
- Eight individually addressable and controllable 110 VAC outlets
- Two TP-Link Kasa HS103 Wifi mini-outlets
- A DHT11 temperature/humidity sensor

## Planned Upgrades
- Upgrade DHT11 to DHT22
- Probably add more HS103s to control more things
